Minoxidil is best for those who have minimal thinning — it will not give you back a full head of hair, but it can provide some assistance. Although generally an effective option, some do report it not working, while others see results in 6 months or sooner. If you ever decide to stop taking minoxidil, you will lose the new hair growth as well as the hair that would have been lost had you not taken any medication.",
      "Finasteride is more known for slowing down hair loss by 90%, but it does not provide much hair growth or strengthening. Results show in 6 months and, just like minoxidil, when you stop taking it, hair loss returns. Finasteride has more known side effects such as a lower libido, depression, and erectile dysfunction. These side effects can linger even after quitting the medication. Weigh your options with a physician before taking any medication that can alter your life.",

                <p>
                  Male pattern baldness, otherwise known as androgenic alopecia,
                  accounts for more than 95% of hair loss in men. By the age of
                  35, two thirds of men in the U.S. will have some degree of
                  hair loss, and by age 50 about 85% of men will have
                  significant hair thinning or hair loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is usually genetic. Family history of hair loss or
                  baldness makes you more susceptible. Androgens, the male sex
                  hormones in charge of hair growth, begin to weaken the
                  follicle, creating shorter, finer hair, and eventually no
                  growth at all.

                  Unfortunately there is no outright cure for male pattern
                  baldness. Luckily, there are ways to slow it down, and
                  options that give you a full, natural-looking head of hair
                  while you decide what else, if anything, you want to pursue
                  with a physician.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Knowing what options you have, and which one is actually
                  right for you, is the key. Medications, PRP, and surgery are
                  paths some men explore. At ManHair, we specialize in
                  non-surgical topical hair replacement: a custom system that
                  covers the hairline and crown immediately, blended with the
                  hair you still have.

                  Topical hair replacement starts by preparing the surface of
                  your head if any remaining hair needs to be evened, then
                  applying a medical-grade adhesive. That bond lasts 3–4 weeks
                  and is refreshed at a maintenance visit each month. A custom
                  hair unit is placed on top and cut and styled to the look
                  you want. Units typically last about 6 months before they
                  are replaced, as they shed like real human hair.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With a topical unit you can exercise, shower, and sleep with
                  it on. It is a 24/7 system, secured with the correct
                  adhesives. Your scalp can still breathe through the mesh
                  lining where the hair is attached, so it sits comfortably —
                  most clients say they almost cannot feel it. There are no
                  medication side effects, and the look is realistic and
                  undetectable when it is fitted and cut in correctly.
